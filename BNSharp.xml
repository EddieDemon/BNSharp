            <summary>
            When implemented, allows a class to provide custom packet parsing priorities for BN# via the 
            <see cref="M:BNSharp.BattleNet.BattleNetClient.RegisterCustomPacketPriorities(BNSharp.Plugins.IPacketPriorityProvider)">RegisterCustomPacketPriorities</see> method.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>BN# uses a layered approach to custom packet priorities.  By default, all packet priorities 
            are Normal.  Registering a new packet priority provider will allow the new provider to allow High or Low 
            priorities to be defined without needing to define priorities for all packets.</para>
            <para>Once a lookup is performed for a given packet ID, the result is cached and reused.  Consequently, changing
            the priority value returned across multiple calls will only be reflected if the registered priority providers
            change across calls, at which point the cache is invalidated.</para>
            <para>The priority providers are checked in the most-recently-registered order; so consequently, if three 
            priority providers are registered in the order A, B, then C, then C will be checked first.</para>

            <para>Battle.net-related events driven by <see>BattleNetClient</see> are guaranteed to execute sequentially, in the order in which they
            were registered relative to other event handlers of their priority.</para>
            <example>
            <para>For example, consider a scenario in which there are three handlers registered for the <see cref="E:BNSharp.BattleNet.BattleNetClient.UserJoined">UserJoined event</see>; 
            one is registered at High <see>Priority</see> and two are registered at Low priority:</para>

                <item>High: Moderation.ChannelModerationHandler.client_UserJoined(System.Object, BNSharp.UserEventArgs)</item>

                <item>Low: Client.UI.ChannelDisplay.client_UserJoined(System.Object, BNSharp.UserEventArgs)</item>
            </list>
            <para>Unlike normal .NET event handlers, every one of those handlers are guaranteed to be called back, regardless of whether a prior handler caused an 
            exception to be thrown.  However, if an exception is thrown, the <see cref="E:BNSharp.BattleNet.BattleNetClient.EventExceptionThrown">EventExceptionThrown event</see>
            will be raised on the client.  So, the sequence of external method calls that would happen in such an event, if the Moderation handler threw an exception, 
            would be something along these lines:</para>
            <list type="bullet">
                <item>ChannelModerationHandler.client_UserJoined (raises exception)</item>
                <item>BattleNetClient.EventExceptionThrown</item>
                <item>ChatDisplay.client_UserJoined</item>
                <item>ChannelDisplay.client_UserJoined</item>
            </list>
            </example>
            <para>Typically, all listeners of the EventExceptionThrown event are <b>not</b> guaranteed to be called and follow normal .NET event semantics.</para>

            <remarks>
            <para>By default, the revision check operation for non-Lockdown clients uses dynamic compilation based on 
            the standard format of the revision check formula (<c>A=x B=y C=z 4 A=A?S B=B?C C=C?A A=A?B</c>).  If there
            is a compatibility problem, clients can disable the use of dynamic compilation by setting this property
            to <see langword="true"/>.</para>
            <para>In the current version of MBNCSUtil and BN#, setting this property to <see langword="true"/> has the effect of causing the
            revision check process to use the <see cref="F:BNSharp.MBNCSUtil.CheckRevisionOptimizationStrategy.LoadFilesOnDemand">LoadFilesOnDemand</see> 
            <see cref="P:BNSharp.MBNCSUtil.CheckRevision.OptimizationStrategy">optimization strategy</see>, regardless of the value of that property, to ensure 100% compatibility with

            Reads all the files and inserts the appropriate padding before executing the revision check, allowing the 
            operation to execute in a single pass without (generally) needing to hit the disk.  This is the default 
            optimization strategy, and will use about 11mb of memory transitionally during the operation of the check,
            but will free it following the check.

            <summary>
            Reads all of the files and inserts the appropriate padding before executing the revision check, based on a 
            combination of the names of the files that are being used.  This allows the operation to execute in a single
            pass without needing to hit the disk.  When the revision check is completed, the file data are retained so 
            that future calls don't need to recombine the file data.  For clients that use classic revision check, this
            means that files will take about 11mb each.  For clients that use lockdown, because the lockdown file is part
            of the hashed file data, this may be up to about 200mb.  This strategy is probably ideal for applications 
            similar to BNLS that need to focus on serving revision check requests, and not for general client use.

            Reads files one kilobyte at a time, as the revision check needs the file data to be read in.  This is probably 
            the slowest optimization strategy, but it probably will hit the disk more than once during the operation.
            It also uses the least amount of memory.
