        The BNSharp.Net namespace contains types that facilitate client connections.  Specifically, the <see>BattleNetClient</see>
        class may be used as a highly-contained client connection to Battle.net, whereas a <see>ConnectionBase</see> may be more appropriate for someone
        interested in implementing a new client protocol.
